A Deep learning project to predict species of bird
# Bird Species Recognition using Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to recognize and classify different species of birds from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

Bird species identification is an important task in biodiversity monitoring and ecological studies. Manual identification is time-consuming and requires expertise. This project automates the process using a CNN-based model trained on bird images to achieve high accuracy in classification.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN-based feature extraction and classification
- Model training and evaluation
- Confusion matrix and classification report for performance analysis
- Visualization of training progress

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

The dataset is divided into two folders:
- *Training set*: Images for training the model
- *Test set*: Images for evaluating the model

Each folder contains subfolders, where each subfolder corresponds to a bird species.
